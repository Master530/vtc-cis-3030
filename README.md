### Recommended Setup
Cabal is required to build/run the testsuite and main application of each subdirectory in this repository.
1. Install [GHCup](https://www.haskell.org/ghcup/)
        - Windows users without WSL2, click  `Show all platforms` to reveal installation directly in Windows PowerShell
2. Verify the installation was successfull by typing `ghcup tui` in the commandline/powershell. You should see a textual overlay summarization the installed versions of GHcup, Stack, cabal, and GHC

Contact your instructor immediately if you are unable to complete the installation described above.
